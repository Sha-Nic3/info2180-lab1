## Branching
Branching allows you to isolate development work without 
affecting other branches in the repository. Each repository 
has one default branch (usually called master), and can havemultiple other branches.

## Webpage
A webpage is a digital document that is accessed through the internet and displayed in a web browser. It typically contains a mix of text, images, videos, and links, providing information or services to users. Webpages are written in languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which help define their structure, style, and interactivity. They serve as the building blocks of websites, offering a user-friendly interface for browsing content, performing tasks, or engaging with web-based applications.
